== Set up

Edit run.sh to set the MPIX_Launch location.

== noop.x

These examples run noop.x: see its https://github.com/CODARcode/SwiftExamples/apps[README] for details.

== Example a.swift

Runs the simple MPI program ../apps/noop.x with 1, 2, 4, 8 processes.

Run with:

----
$ ./run.sh a 9
swift: launching: ../apps/noop.x on 1 processes
swift: launching: ../apps/noop.x on 2 processes
swift: launching: ../apps/noop.x on 4 processes
swift: launching: ../apps/noop.x on 8 processes
...
----

where 9 is the number of processes.  The number 9 is chosen because this is the size of the largest task (8) + 1 process for Swift.

== Example b.swift

Runs the simple MPI program ../apps/noop.x 4 times in two rounds, each noop.x has 2 processes.  Each noop.x reports start/stop timestamps so you can easily tell what was running at each point in time.  Each noop.x execution is labeled with a unique number 0-3.

Run with:

----
$ ./run.sh b 5
swift: launching: ../apps/noop.x (0) on 2 processes
swift: launching: ../apps/noop.x (1) on 2 processes
swift: launching: ../apps/noop.x (2) on 2 processes
swift: launching: ../apps/noop.x (3) on 2 processes
noop 0: start: 1500397975
noop 3: start: 1500397975
noop 0: stop:  1500397976
noop 3: stop:  1500397976
noop 2: start: 1500397976
noop 1: start: 1500397976
noop 2: stop:  1500397977
noop 1: stop:  1500397977
